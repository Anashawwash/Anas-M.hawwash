### üìù Before Programming

Before starting my programming journey, I was a college student at **An-Najah University**, studying **Physical Therapy** for the past three years. I also tried to become a **beekeeper**, and I was successful for two years. However, I realized there was a gap between what I was studying and what I really wanted to do. That‚Äôs why I started learning programming. My first course was **CS50 from Harvard**, which sparked my passion for coding and web development.

### üìÇ Projects

**1. [DojoWeather](#)**  
A simple weather interface project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project helped me practice **creating layouts and interactive elements** without relying on frameworks.  

**2. [Calculator](#)**  
A basic HTML calculator where I implemented the **logic using JavaScript** and styled the design with **CSS**. This project taught me how to **combine design and functionality** in web development.  

**3. [HTML, CSS, and JS Exam](#)**  
Completed a practical exam on **CSS and JavaScript** with excellent results. This project demonstrates my ability to **apply styling and interactivity concepts** learned during my studies.

### üí° Personal Note  

Besides coding, I have a curious and adventurous spirit. I was a **beekeeper for two years**, and before that, I studied **Physical Therapy** at An-Najah University. I enjoy **learning new technologies, solving problems, and building projects** that challenge me. I‚Äôm always motivated to **grow as a developer** and explore the endless possibilities in the world of programming.

# 👋 Hi, I’m Anas I’m a beginner programmer currently studying full-time to become a **full-stack developer**. I’m learning **HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript**, and I’m passionate about building web applications and improving my coding skills every day. --- ### 🛠 Skills **Programming Languages:** ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white) ![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) ![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JS-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black) ![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white) **Tools & Platforms:** ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) ![VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS%20Code-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white) ![MySQL Workbench](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL%20Workbench-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white) **Frameworks & Libraries:** ![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bootstrap-7952B3?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white) ![Tailwind CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind_CSS-06B6D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white) --- ### 📝 Before Programming Before starting my programming journey, I was a college student at **An-Najah University**, studying **Physical Therapy** for the past three years. I also tried to become a **beekeeper**, and I was successful for two years. However, I realized there was a gap between what I was studying and what I really wanted to do. That’s why I started learning programming. My first course was **CS50 from Harvard**, which sparked my passion for coding and web development. --- ### 📂 Projects **1. [DojoWeather](#)** A simple weather interface project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project helped me practice **creating layouts and interactive elements** without relying on frameworks. **2. [Calculator](#)** A basic HTML calculator where I implemented the **logic using JavaScript** and styled the design with **CSS**. This project taught me how to **combine design and functionality** in web development. **3. [HTML, CSS, and JS Exam](#)** Completed a practical exam on **CSS and JavaScript** with excellent results. This project demonstrates my ability to **apply styling and interactivity concepts** learned during my studies. *(Replace # with your GitHub project links if available)* --- ### 🎯 Future Goals - Become a confident **full-stack developer** by mastering both **front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks)** and **back-end technologies**. - Build **real-world web applications** that cover both client-side and server-side development. - Learn and strengthen skills in **databases, server-side programming, and deployment**. - Contribute to **open-source projects** and collaborate with other developers to gain practical experience. --- ### 💡 Personal Note Besides coding, I have a curious and adventurous spirit. I was a **beekeeper for two years**, and before that, I studied **Physical Therapy** at An-Najah University. I enjoy **learning new technologies, solving problems, and building projects** that challenge me. I’m always motivated to **grow as a developer** and explore the endless possibilities in the world of programming.
